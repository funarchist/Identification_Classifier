# KYC System with Image Processing and Machine Learning

This repository showcases the work performed during my second-year summer internship at Amani Technologies Limited, a reg-tech startup based in the UAE. The project spanned 8 weeks, starting on June 12, 2019, and ending on August 2, 2019. The primary focus was the development of a Know Your Customer (KYC) system module for identity verification using images of identity documents.

## Project Overview
The division I worked in focused on designing and implementing an end-to-end system for:
1. **Classifying Document Types**: Identifying the type of identity document (e.g., passport, ID card, driver's license).
2. **Extracting Relevant Information**: Parsing critical information such as names, IDs, and expiration dates.
3. **Database Comparison**: Validating extracted information against an existing customer database.
4. **Providing Output**: Returning all extracted and verified information with a confidence level.

The project's primary customer was **First Abu Dhabi Bank**, and the system was tailored to the majority of the United Arab Emirates population within a constrained timeline.

## Key Features
- **Identity Document Classification**: Utilized machine learning algorithms to classify document types based on input images.
- **Information Extraction**: Implemented image processing techniques to extract relevant details.
- **Forgery Detection**: Compared document consistency against the database to identify potential forgeries.
- **Scalability**: Delivered a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and further enriched and scaled the system within the internship duration.

## Documentation
1. **Design Details**: The design process and implementation steps are documented in the project report.
2. **Codebase**: All Python scripts are included in the codebase file.
3. **References**: Resources used for design decisions are listed in the report's references section.

## Conclusion
This project was a valuable opportunity to explore the intersection of image processing and machine learning in the field of identity verification. It contributed to building a scalable and reliable KYC system that addresses real-world challenges in identity document validation.
